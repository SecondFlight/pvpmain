The heck is this?
=================

It's a bukkit plugin I'm working on for a server.

What server?
============

I'll tell you once it matters, aka once the network is up and running, and once I feel good enough about this monster to connect its development to the server.

Why is it so bad?
=================

Because I have literally no idea what I'm doing.

Wait, really?
=========

Yeah, pretty much. I learn as I go.

Wow, this code really is bad.
============================

Well you could help me -_-

How can I help?
===============

Submit ideas or bug reports or general rants as issues, and I'll look over them.
